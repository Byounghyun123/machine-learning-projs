# machine-learning-projs
This is a repository for my personal machine learning projects. Most of the projects will use Python and TensorFlow to build models alongside multiple APIs.

Projects:
- Human Classification Using Convoluted Neural Networks (CNN) via TensorFlow, Keras & Python
- Rock Scissors Paper Classification (Multi_class Classification)
